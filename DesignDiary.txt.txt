summary:
	Our final milestone gave us a lot of freedom, which made me really enjoy the whole process of creating the project. This project by far was not only my best, but one that I enjoyed creating 
	most. I learned so much while doing this project such as the implementation of classes within a project, and the use of references. This are all things that I have struggled with,
	but since I had to use them it forced me to learn how to actually implement them in my code. Some of the differences I noticed while doing this project in compared to others was 
	the excitement to actually do the project. To me it didn't seem like a homework assignment that needed to be graded, but a project that I wanted to do. For future advice for this assignment
	I say keep it the same, because it is really exciting to do, and create something that truly is yours. Also I just wanted to thank you for being such a good professor. I appreciate 
	the difficulty and the way you run the class.
