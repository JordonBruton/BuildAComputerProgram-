Project Goal: I'm going to make a program in which given certain factors and criteria it will give you all of the parts it reccomends in order to build a pc
	- As of right now I'm just going to do counsel app, but depending on how it goes I could possibly implement it into unity
	- Reason behind picking this topic is because I'm in the proccess of building one, and I find myself to have the most joy coding when seeing how it can really be applied 

Factors that affect the build:
	- Budget
		- Size of tower (mirco/mid/ETAX) 
	- Plan for what you want to do with this computer 
	

How will I organize information:
	- Vectors to store different hardware 
	- Hashtables - Can categoize each part and put them under a certain name in order to access that part 
	- Binary Search Tree(BST) - Could make options a lot simpler but cutting hardward options based off of price 

Other Things I can add:
	- accesories 
		- Headphones 
		- Mouses 
		- Keyboards

Parts You Need To Build a Computer:
	- CPU (Proccesor)
	- GPU (Graphics Card)
	- Power Supply
	- RAM (Memeory)
	- Tower (deskstop case)
	- MotherBoard
	- SSD (opitonal(faster))
	- Hard Drive(??)

Idea:
	- Using the numbers 1-3 to distinguish the different price ranges (i.e 1 being the cheapest and 3 being the most expensive)
		- We can use this in ordered to decide on particular parts
	- Creating different classes for each part
		- Use unordered_map to dinstugish the price point
	- If their option is to create a pc then we can put the ending product to a file
